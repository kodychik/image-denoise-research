## Principles of CNNs

CNNs introduce an innovative approach to processing images by leveraging spatial hierarchies. The key components of CNNs include:

1. Convolutional Layers - Extract local features using filters that move across the input image.
2. Max-Pooling Layers - Reduce spatial dimensions while retaining important features, enhancing computational efficiency.
3. Fully Connected Layers - Aggregate learned features for classification or regression tasks.

## Architectures Explored

AlexNet and VGG (Image Processing Tasks)

Explored these networks' layered structures, with features like deep convolutional layers, max-pooling, and fully connected layers for classification tasks like ImageNet.

U-Net (Image Restoration Tasks)

Studied U-Net's encoder-decoder architecture, which combines downsampling (for context) with skip connections (for spatial detail preservation) to perform tasks like image segmentation.

## Implementation

To reinforce these concepts, I followed TensorFlow tutorials to implement a 4-layer convolutional network for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. This hands-on work demonstrated the power of CNNs in capturing spatial patterns and improving classification accuracy.
