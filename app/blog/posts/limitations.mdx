While fully connected networks are powerful, they are unsuitable for solving real-world image processing problems. Key limitations include:

## Large Parameter Counts

Fully connected networks require a large number of weights when applied to high-dimensional data like images, leading to high memory usage and computational inefficiency.

## Lack of Spatial Awareness

They fail to capture spatial hierarchies and local patterns inherent in images, making tasks like object detection and segmentation infeasible.

## Realization

This realization paved the way for exploring Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a more effective solution for image-related tasks.
