summary: "My journey of understanding the building blocks of neural networks"
---

During the initial weeks of my research, I focused on understanding the building blocks of neural networks and the underlying algorithms used for training them. This involved:

## Units of Computation and Non-linearities

Learned about the fundamental units of neural networks such as perceptrons and the role of activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid) in introducing non-linear capabilities, which enable neural networks to model complex patterns.

## Architectures of 1-layer and 2-layer Neural Networks

Implemented fully connected networks with one and two layers in C programming language to gain hands-on experience with forward and backward propagation. This reinforced my understanding of gradient computation, weight updates, and error backpropagation.

## Findings

Through these exercises, I developed a deep appreciation for the mathematical rigor and computational efficiency of neural networks. Writing the networks in C provided insight into the granular operations that drive machine learning libraries.
