# Deep Learning-Based Image Denoising Using FFDNet

> **Published:** 2024-12-06  
> **Summary:** This report dives into the implementation and evaluation of FFDNet for image denoising tasks, including results from training and testing on the SSID dataset.

## üîç Introduction

Image denoising is a critical problem in computer vision. It aims to remove noise while preserving details, improving image quality for downstream tasks like object detection or medical imaging.

## üöÄ Objective

The primary goal of this project was to:

- Explore **FFDNet**, a convolutional neural network-based approach to denoising.
- Train and test the model on the **SSID Dataset**.
- Analyze and compare performance using **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)**.

## üß† What is FFDNet?

FFDNet is a deep learning-based image denoising model that introduces a flexible architecture capable of handling varying noise levels.

### Key Features of FFDNet:

- **Noise Map Input**: Dynamically adjusts denoising strength based on input noise levels.
- **Efficiency**: Faster inference compared to traditional denoising techniques like BM3D.
- **Architecture**:
  - Initial downsampling to reduce spatial dimensions.
  - Convolution layers with ReLU activation and batch normalization.
  - Final upscaling to restore the image.

## üî¨ Research Insights: "Deep Learning Revolution and Beyond"

### Summary of the Paper:

- **Authors**: Michael Elad, Bahjat Kawar, and Gregory Vaksman.
- **Objective**: Explores the evolution of deep learning for image denoising.
- **Key Findings**:
  1. Traditional methods like BM3D provide excellent results but lack adaptability.
  2. Deep learning models, such as FFDNet and U-Net, offer flexibility and scalability.
  3. Noise level maps are critical for handling spatially varying noise.

This paper provided the theoretical foundation for implementing and testing FFDNet.

## üìä Experiment Details

### Dataset:

- **SSID Dataset**: Contains images with varying noise levels, simulating real-world conditions.

### Environment Challenges:

Training on macOS was limited due to the lack of **CUDA** support. Instead, pre-trained models were tested and evaluated.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Configuration

### Architecture Highlights:

- **Preprocessing**: Input normalization by subtracting mean RGB values.
- **Convolution Layers**: 3√ó3 filters, stride 1, and padding to maintain spatial dimensions.
- **Max-Pooling**: 2√ó2 pixel windows with a stride of 2.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Three layers, with 1000 output channels for classification.

## üìà Results and Analysis

### Test Results (PSNR in dB):

| **Image**   | **PSNR (dB)** |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| `test_14`   | **27.15**     |
| `test_28`   | **28.02**     |
| `test_29`   | **31.67**     |
| `test_15`   | **26.46**     |
| `test_9`    | **30.70**     |
| **...**     | **...**       |
| **Average** | **28.91**     |

A very good score of 28.91 dB for the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio.

### Key Observations:

- Images with higher noise levels achieved **lower PSNR** values.
- FFDNet effectively preserved details in moderately noisy images.
- Performance degrades slightly for images with extremely high noise.

## üåü Conclusion

FFDNet represents a significant advancement in image denoising, balancing flexibility and efficiency. While traditional methods like BM3D are still valuable, deep learning approaches offer adaptability to various noise conditions.

### Limitations:

- Dependence on accurate noise maps.
- Limited receptive field compared to fully dilated networks.

## üìö Future Work

- Explore **multi-scale CNNs** for denoising.
- Test FFDNet on other datasets, such as **DIV2K** or **BSD300**.
- Investigate hybrid models combining traditional and deep learning methods.
